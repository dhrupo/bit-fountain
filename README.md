I have used very less CSS because I don't want the project look like fancy. The whole project is based on Medical Device Equipment. So as an enterprise level application, I kept the design minimalistic. I have mainly relied on bootstrap.

On Home page, I have displayed available medical devices by using /modeltype api. I have The model type data to first 30 elements. Then selecting a model led to device detail's data using //modeldata api which displayed over an Modal using react modal package. To add new device model, used /devicemodel api and get all typeid through /devicetype api and presented in a select list. Implemented Login/Logout -authentication based on Oauth api 2.0 key to use the app. And used bootstrap spinner for loading the page.

I am a novice in basis of typeScript. Actually this is my first attempt on use typescript with react. So I need to learn the basics first then apply it. I tried my level best to make the app as the documentation says. Thanks for your valuable time and consideration. Have a great day.
